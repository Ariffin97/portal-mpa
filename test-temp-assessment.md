# Testing Temporary Assessment System

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

### What was implemented:

#### 🗄️ Database Schema Updates:
- Added `isTemporary` boolean field (default: false)
- Added `parentFormId` reference to original form
- Added `expiresAt` date field with MongoDB TTL index
- Added `generatedBy` field to track who generated the code
- Created indexes for efficient querying

#### 🔌 API Endpoints:
- **POST** `/api/assessment/forms/:formId/generate-temp-code`
  - Generates 24-hour temporary codes starting with 'T'
  - Returns code, expiry time, and parent form info
  - Prevents temporary codes from temporary forms

- **GET** `/api/assessment/forms/:code` (Enhanced)
  - Now checks expiry for temporary forms
  - Returns additional expiry information
  - Proper error handling for expired codes

- **POST** `/api/assessment/submissions` (Enhanced)
  - Validates form expiry before accepting submissions
  - Prevents submissions to expired temporary forms

#### 🎨 Frontend Features:
- **Admin Dashboard**: New "Generate Temp Code" button
- **Smart notifications** with expiry details and clipboard copy
- **Assessment System**: Expiry warnings for users
- **Better error messages** for expired/invalid codes
- **API service** integration for temporary code generation

#### 🔒 Security Features:
- **24-hour auto-expiry** with MongoDB TTL
- **'T' prefix** for easy identification of temporary codes
- **IP tracking** of who generated codes
- **Prevents recursive** temporary code creation
- **Real-time expiry checking** throughout the system

### How to use:

1. **Admin generates temp code**:
   - Go to Saved Assessment Forms
   - Click "Generate Temp Code" on any form
   - System shows code with expiry details
   - Copy code to clipboard

2. **User takes assessment**:
   - Enter temporary code (starts with 'T')
   - System shows expiry warnings if < 2 hours left
   - Assessment works normally until expiry

3. **Automatic cleanup**:
   - MongoDB automatically deletes expired forms
   - No manual cleanup needed

### Benefits achieved:

✅ **Enhanced Security**: Codes expire automatically
✅ **Better Control**: Track who generates codes
✅ **User Experience**: Clear expiry warnings
✅ **Admin Efficiency**: One-click temporary code generation
✅ **Audit Trail**: IP tracking and timestamps
✅ **Zero Maintenance**: Auto-cleanup via MongoDB TTL

### System is ready for use! 🚀

The temporary assessment system is now fully integrated and provides the security and control you requested.
